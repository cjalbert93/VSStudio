            <h3>Why?</h3>
            <p>"As a visual learner, I struggled
                through more than two decades of
                formal education in the sciences. Throughout this process I discovered the incredibly powerful capacity
                for the brain
                to understand concepts represented by moving objects.

                Ultimately, I discovered that the world lacks a dynamic library, so I got busy building one.
        
                I am proud to
                welcome you early explorers to my humble
                endeavor. I hope you leave this place better than you came."
