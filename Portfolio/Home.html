                <p id="back">Hello! Welcome to my website and portfolio. My name is Colin Jalbert and I am a product designer and
                    mechatronics engineer.
                    I have been making art, designing inventions and building mechatronics projects my entire life which led me to attain
                    a
                    bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering in the spring of 2019.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Since then I have worked both professionally and personally as a product designer and engineer to ever
                    improve
                    my ability to create useful and wonderful things.
                    I am very familiar with the US patenting process, have 10+ years of 3D modeling experience and I
                    am at
                    my best when pacing around a silent room or constructively arguing with other designers and engineers.
                    I am very familiar with the prototyping process, designing machines to perfection and communicating with both co-workers
                    and customers to meet their various needs.

            <p id="back">Since graduating in the spring of 2019, I have worked at Made Robotics LLC in San Jose, California designing
                Omnidirectional
                Wheelchairs and successfully helped prototype a full-sized model in the fall of 2020. Through this experience
                I became formidable at designing for manufacturing, technical document preparation and ergonomic design.</p><br>
