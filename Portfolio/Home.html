                <p id="back">Hello! Welcome to my Website and Portfolio. My Name is Colin Jalbert and I am a Product Designer and
                    Mechatronics Engineer.
                    I have been Making Art, Inventions and Various Curious Objects my entire life which led me to attain
                    a
                    Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering in the Spring of 2019.
                    Since then I have worked both Professionally and Personally as a Product Designer and Engineer to ever
                    improve
                    my ability to hopefully create great and wonderful things.
                    I am very familiar with the US Patenting process, have 10+ Years of 3D Modeling Experience and I
                    am at
                    my best when pacing around a silent room or constructively arguing with other designers and engineers.
                    I am very familiar with the Prototyping Process and its' Machines, Prototype Assembly and Documentation.

            <p id="back">Since graduating in the Spring of 2019, I have worked at Made Robotics LLC where we designed Open Source
                Transformable
                Wheelchairs and Successfully Prototyped a Full-Sized Model in the fall of 2020. Through this experience
                I became familiar with
                the stages of Research and Development into invention Patenting, consumer data Analytic Optimization and
                became comfortable with a
